<img src="http://somewebsite.com/image.jpg" alt="short description">
The source attribute, src, is like the href of a link - it is the URL of the

You'll learn about another way to set image source in the next exercise. The alt attribute stands for "alternative description," which is important for people who use screen readers to browse the web. This is text that will show up in lieu of the actual image.
